Description:

    This program will generate a vector of the size indicated by the user. And will perform operations and
    comparisons (using input by the user) on that vector before finally transforming it.

Usage:

    Enter an integer value for the size then for the value that will later be compared to the elements of 
    the vector. Information will be displayed as described in the output. Type ./generics in the CLI to run 
    the program after following setup instructions.

Setup:

    Developed in WSL 2.0 environment using a g++ compiler. Makefile is provided, so just type "make" in the
    CLI to compile. There is also a "make clean" option to delete the .exe. Includes the vector, stdlib and
    iostream header files.
